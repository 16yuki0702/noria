types:
+ aggregation (count, sum, etc)
T base (specify columns, ??)
? extremum (min/max)
? filter (conditions)
? groupconcat ??
|X| join/leftjoin (match tables given columns that need to match from each; project??)
pi project (give certain columns, plus constants and arithmetic)
U union (table has entries from all inputs; all column types must match)
? topk (k biggest, given an order and columns to care about)
Distinct (get entries with diff values for spec column)
Reuse (seems to be non-SQL, just for mir parsing?)
T leaf (query read; whatâ€™s keys??)
Rewrite (how is this different from reuse?)
